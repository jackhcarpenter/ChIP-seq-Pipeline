# ChIP-seq Pipeline
-----
 This repository contains a collection of scripts that processes Illumina next generation sequencing data, performed on chromatin immunoprecipitated samples to assess enrichment of genomic loci in the sample. The scripts should be run in numerical order and depends on 9 files: At_reference_genome, beds, bowtie, fastqc,logs, markdup, RAW_DATA, trimmed_reads, and wigs. 

 Scripts are adapted from Dr Tamara Lechon's repository at https://github.com/TamaraLechon/ChIPseq-pipelines
